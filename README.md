My 6th assignment, brings a lot of things together to make a fully operational program. It'll prevent divide by zero errors on the calculator, as well as incorrect choices or too few numbers inputted. I did stop with one thing before it got out of scope however; instead of allowing someone to add multiple items at once I kept it to a single addition/removal per command. This is much easier to actually use later on via buttons, and mass add/remove is spotty as a user at the best of times. Definitely a long term upgrade thing rather than core functionality. Fun though!
